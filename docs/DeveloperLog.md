# Developer Progress Log — October 2025

## Saturday, Oct 11

**Focus:** Project structure and Date Validation foundation  
**Hours active:** 3.5 hrs

### Completed

- Set up core validation framework:
  - TradeValidationResult
  - TradeValidationEngine
  - TradeDateValidator (basic version implemented)
- Wrote and ran first failing test (failWhenMaturityBeforeStartDate)
- Connected validation flow with TradeValidationServiceTest
- Confirmed integration structure working (TDD RED phase)
- Git operations:
  - Created new branch feat/comprehensive-trade-validation-engine
  - Committed initial failing test and validation classes
- Planned structure for future validators (User, Leg, Entity)

### Learned / Understood Better

- Role of ChronoUnit.DAYS.between() and why it returns a long type
- How to structure reusable validators for maintainability
- Purpose of separating TradeValidationResult and TradeValidationEngine
- Importance of TDD phases (Red → Green → Refactor)

### Challenges / Notes

- Took me time to decide the structure of classes and methods
- Needed clarity on exception handling (decided to use result aggregation pattern instead of throwing)
- Found writing tests before logic methods harder than writing the logic then tests
- Progress slower due to balancing with home tasks

### Tomorrow (Sunday, Oct 12)

**Goal:** Complete all Date Validation Rule tests and logic (GREEN phase)  
**Estimated time:** ~4–5 hours

#### Tasks

1. Write new failing tests:
   - failWhenStartBeforeTradeDate()
   - failWhenTradeDateOlderThan30Days()
2. Run tests and confirm RED
3. Implement logic in TradeDateValidator
   - Use ChronoUnit.DAYS for 30-day rule
   - Ensure clear error messages
4. Run tests and confirm all GREEN
5. Commit messages:
   - "test(validation): add failing tests for start date and 30-day trade date rules"
   - "fix(validation): implement complete date validation logic"
6. Optional: test through TradeValidationEngine

## Sunday 12 October 2025

### Focus

Enhancement 2: Comprehensive Trade Validation Engine  
Expanded test coverage and implemented multiple validation layers.

### Tasks Completed

- Completed all **Date Validation Rules**:
  - Wrote and passed tests for:
    - “Start date cannot be before trade date.”
    - “Trade date cannot be more than 30 days in the past.”
  - Implemented corresponding logic in `TradeDateValidator`.
  - All date validation tests now passing.
- Implemented **User Privilege Enforcement** rules:
  - Added `UserPrivilegeValidator` class handling user-type-based permissions.
  - Wrote comprehensive unit test `UserPrivilegeValidatorTest` covering:
    - TRADER: can perform CREATE, AMEND, TERMINATE, CANCEL.
    - SALES: limited to CREATE and AMEND.
    - MIDDLE_OFFICE: can AMEND and VIEW only.
    - SUPPORT: can VIEW only.
  - All privilege validation tests passed successfully.
- Started **Cross-Leg Business Rules**:
  - Added `maturityDate` to `TradeLegDTO`.
  - Created `TradeLegValidator` and corresponding test for rule:
    - “Both legs must have identical maturity dates.”
  - Test passed on first run.
- Created new learning reference file `validation-learning-links.md` covering:
  - ValidationResult and ValidationEngine design patterns.
  - XMLUnit `ValidationResult` inspiration.
  - Articles on Chain of Responsibility and Rule Engine design.

### Key Learnings

- Using `ValidationResult` allows collecting multiple business rule errors without exceptions.
- Separate validators (date, privilege, leg) keep validation logic modular and maintainable.
- Learned difference between user roles and validation engine orchestration.
- Reinforced understanding of TDD — writing tests first made implementation clearer and faster.

### Next Steps

- Write and implement tests for remaining Cross-Leg Business Rules:
  - Opposite pay/receive flags.
  - Floating legs must have an index.
  - Fixed legs must have a valid rate.
- Begin planning for Entity Status Validation:
  - Verify user, book, and counterparty activity checks.
- Start drafting internal documentation on validation design approach.

## Monday, Oct 13

**Focus:** Finalising comprehensive trade validation and planning dashboard enhancement  
**Hours active:** 4 hrs

### Completed

- Finished all remaining Cross-Leg Business Rule tests and logic:
  - Opposite pay/receive flags
  - Floating legs must have an index
  - Fixed legs must have a valid rate
- Refactored validation architecture for separation of concerns:
  - Moved entity status and reference validation to new `EntityStatusValidationEngine`
  - Ensured `TradeValidationEngine` only handles business rules
- Implemented and tested Entity Status Validation:
  - User, book, and counterparty must be active in the system
  - All reference data must exist and be valid
- Updated and fixed all failing tests:
  - Aligned test assertions with actual error messages
  - Confirmed all validation tests pass
- Committed and pushed changes to remote branch
- Documented error/fix details in `Development-Errors-and-fixes.md`
- Confirmed correct usage of `TradeValidationResult` and validation engines in all test classes

### Key Learnings

- Modular validation engines make codebase easier to maintain and extend
- Centralised result object (`TradeValidationResult`) simplifies error handling and test assertions
- Refactoring for SRP and separation of concerns improves clarity and scalability
- Systematic test review ensures robust coverage and prevents regression

### Challenges / Notes

- Needed to update test assertions to match validator error messages
- Refactoring required careful coordination between engine and validator classes
- Ensured all validation logic is covered by tests before committing

### Tomorrow (Tuesday, Oct 14) — Plan

**Goal:** Start Enhancement 3: Trader Dashboard and Blotter System  
**Estimated time:** ~4–5 hours

#### Tasks

1. Design and implement REST endpoints for trader dashboard:
   - `@GetMapping("/my-trades")` — Trader's personal trades
   - `@GetMapping("/book/{id}/trades")` — Book-level trade aggregation
   - `@GetMapping("/summary")` — Trade portfolio summaries
   - `@GetMapping("/daily-summary")` — Daily trading statistics
2. Create new DTOs:
   - `TradeSummaryDTO` (trade status counts, notional by currency, breakdowns, risk summaries)
   - `DailySummaryDTO` (today's trade count, user metrics, book activity, historical comparison)
3. Implement business requirements:
   - Authenticated user sees only their relevant trades
   - Real-time summary calculations
   - Support for multiple currency exposures
   - Historical comparison capabilities
4. Write unit and integration tests for new endpoints and DTOs
5. Document dashboard design and implementation approach

# Developer Progress Log — October 2025

## Tuesday, Oct 14, 2025

**Focus:** Enhancement 3 — Trader Dashboard and Blotter System  
**Hours active:** 5 hrs

### Completed

- Fully implemented **Trader Dashboard and Blotter System** to meet the business requirement:  
  _“As a trader, I need personalised dashboard views and summary statistics so that I can monitor my positions and make informed trading decisions.”_

#### Key Deliverables

- Implemented **new REST endpoints** in `TradeDashboardService`:

  - `GET /my-trades` — Returns authenticated trader’s personal trades using Spring Security context.
  - `GET /book/{id}/trades` — Provides book-level trade aggregation with privilege validation.
  - `GET /summary` — Generates real-time portfolio summaries (trades by status, notional by currency, and counterparty breakdowns).
  - `GET /daily-summary` — Produces daily trade metrics with historical comparisons (today vs yesterday).

- Created **new DTOs** to structure API responses:

  - `TradeSummaryDTO`:
    - Trade count by status (e.g., NEW, CANCELLED)
    - Notional totals by currency (multi-currency exposure)
    - Breakdown by trade type and counterparty
    - Placeholder for risk exposure summaries (e.g., delta, vega)
  - `DailySummaryDTO`:
    - Today’s trade count and total notional
    - User performance metrics
    - Book-level trade summaries (trade count, notional)
    - Historical comparisons between today and yesterday

- Integrated **UserPrivilegeValidationEngine** to enforce role-based access control:
- Validates TRADER, SALES, MIDDLE_OFFICE, and SUPPORT privileges before any dashboard data is shown.

  - Throws `AccessDeniedException (403)` for unauthorised access attempts.

- Implemented **Spring Security integration**:

  - Added helper methods to automatically resolve user identity and role from the security context:
    - `resolveCurrentTraderId()` → identifies the logged-in trader
    - `resolveCurrentUserRole()` → determines user role (TRADER, SALES, etc.)
  - Ensures authenticated users only see **their own trades**.

- Added **real-time summary and aggregation logic**:

  - Implemented in-memory aggregation using Java Streams and `HashMap.merge()` for performance.
  - Supports **multi-currency portfolios** by summing notional values across trade legs.
  - Added historical comparison capability in `getDailySummary()` for daily performance insights.

- Improved **code clarity and maintainability**:

  - Replaced shortened variables (`t`, `ccy`, `pr`) with meaningful names (`tradeDto`, `currency`, `privilegeResult`).
  - Preserved all original comments and added detailed explanations for new logic.

- Updated **`TradeDashboardServiceTest`**:
  - Added tests for all new endpoints and business logic.
  - Mocked privilege validation to simulate user roles.
  - Verified aggregation results, currency totals, and historical comparisons.
  - Confirmed all test cases pass successfully.

### Key Learnings

- Learned how to integrate **business analytics, privilege validation, and security context** in one cohesive service.
- Gained deeper understanding of **real-time data aggregation** using Java Streams.
- Improved understanding of enforcing **role-based data visibility** and user privilege boundaries.
- Reinforced good naming conventions and documentation practices for complex business logic.

### Challenges

- Integrating privilege validation with existing search logic required careful refactoring to avoid regressions.
- Multi-currency aggregation across trade legs introduced complexity and required multiple null checks.
- Ensuring consistent results for today/yesterday comparisons in tests required dynamic date handling.
- Test configuration for privilege simulation took longer than expected.

### Tomorrow (Wednesday, Oct 15, 2025) — Plan

**Goal:** Integration Testing + Begin Step 4 (Bug Investigation and Fix)  
**Estimated time:** ~5–6 hours

#### Tasks

1. **Integration Testing:**

   - Write integration tests for all new dashboard endpoints (`/my-trades`, `/book/{id}/trades`, `/summary`, `/daily-summary`).
   - Verify role-based privilege enforcement, trade filtering, and real-time aggregation.
   - Confirm authenticated user context resolves correctly within test setup.

2. **Step 4: Bug Investigation and Fix (Required)**

   - **Bug ID:** TRD-2025-001
   - **Severity:** High
   - **Symptoms:**
     - Fixed-leg cashflows showing ~100× larger than expected.
     - $10M trade with 3.5% rate generating ~$875,000 instead of ~$87,500.
     - Precision inconsistencies in monetary values.

   **Tasks:**

   - Investigate `calculateCashflowValue()` in `TradeService.java`.
   - Review formulas, data types, and rate conversions for potential precision errors.
   - Identify root cause (likely missing rate-to-decimal conversion and use of `double` instead of `BigDecimal`).
   - Produce a detailed **Root Cause Analysis** report including:
     - Executive Summary
     - Technical Investigation
     - Root Cause Description
     - Proposed Solution and Alternatives
   - Implement bug fix:
     - Convert percentage rates correctly (`3.5% → 0.035`).
     - Replace `double` with `BigDecimal` for monetary accuracy.
   - Write regression tests to validate correct cashflow results and prevent recurrence.
