# Developer Progress Log — October 2025

## Saturday, Oct 11

**Focus:** Project structure and Date Validation foundation  
**Hours active:** 3.5 hrs

### Completed

- Set up core validation framework:
  - TradeValidationResult
  - TradeValidationEngine
  - TradeDateValidator (basic version implemented)
- Wrote and ran first failing test (failWhenMaturityBeforeStartDate)
- Connected validation flow with TradeValidationServiceTest
- Confirmed integration structure working (TDD RED phase)
- Git operations:
  - Created new branch feat/comprehensive-trade-validation-engine
  - Committed initial failing test and validation classes
- Planned structure for future validators (User, Leg, Entity)

### Learned / Understood Better

- Role of ChronoUnit.DAYS.between() and why it returns a long type
- How to structure reusable validators for maintainability
- Purpose of separating TradeValidationResult and TradeValidationEngine
- Importance of TDD phases (Red → Green → Refactor)

### Challenges / Notes

- Took me time to decide the structure of classes and methods
- Needed clarity on exception handling (decided to use result aggregation pattern instead of throwing)
- Found writing tests before logic methods harder than writing the logic then tests
- Progress slower due to balancing with home tasks

### Tomorrow (Sunday, Oct 12)

**Goal:** Complete all Date Validation Rule tests and logic (GREEN phase)  
**Estimated time:** ~4–5 hours

#### Tasks

1. Write new failing tests:
   - failWhenStartBeforeTradeDate()
   - failWhenTradeDateOlderThan30Days()
2. Run tests and confirm RED
3. Implement logic in TradeDateValidator
   - Use ChronoUnit.DAYS for 30-day rule
   - Ensure clear error messages
4. Run tests and confirm all GREEN
5. Commit messages:
   - "test(validation): add failing tests for start date and 30-day trade date rules"
   - "fix(validation): implement complete date validation logic"
6. Optional: test through TradeValidationEngine

## Sunday 12 October 2025

### Focus

Enhancement 2: Comprehensive Trade Validation Engine  
Expanded test coverage and implemented multiple validation layers.

### Tasks Completed

- Completed all **Date Validation Rules**:
  - Wrote and passed tests for:
    - “Start date cannot be before trade date.”
    - “Trade date cannot be more than 30 days in the past.”
  - Implemented corresponding logic in `TradeDateValidator`.
  - All date validation tests now passing.
- Implemented **User Privilege Enforcement** rules:
  - Added `UserPrivilegeValidator` class handling user-type-based permissions.
  - Wrote comprehensive unit test `UserPrivilegeValidatorTest` covering:
    - TRADER: can perform CREATE, AMEND, TERMINATE, CANCEL.
    - SALES: limited to CREATE and AMEND.
    - MIDDLE_OFFICE: can AMEND and VIEW only.
    - SUPPORT: can VIEW only.
  - All privilege validation tests passed successfully.
- Started **Cross-Leg Business Rules**:
  - Added `maturityDate` to `TradeLegDTO`.
  - Created `TradeLegValidator` and corresponding test for rule:
    - “Both legs must have identical maturity dates.”
  - Test passed on first run.
- Created new learning reference file `validation-learning-links.md` covering:
  - ValidationResult and ValidationEngine design patterns.
  - XMLUnit `ValidationResult` inspiration.
  - Articles on Chain of Responsibility and Rule Engine design.

### Key Learnings

- Using `ValidationResult` allows collecting multiple business rule errors without exceptions.
- Separate validators (date, privilege, leg) keep validation logic modular and maintainable.
- Learned difference between user roles and validation engine orchestration.
- Reinforced understanding of TDD — writing tests first made implementation clearer and faster.

### Next Steps

- Write and implement tests for remaining Cross-Leg Business Rules:
  - Opposite pay/receive flags.
  - Floating legs must have an index.
  - Fixed legs must have a valid rate.
- Begin planning for Entity Status Validation:
  - Verify user, book, and counterparty activity checks.
- Start drafting internal documentation on validation design approach.
