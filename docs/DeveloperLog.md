# Developer Progress Log — October 2025

## Saturday, Oct 11

**Focus:** Project structure and Date Validation foundation  
**Hours active:** 3.5 hrs

### Completed

- Set up core validation framework:
  - TradeValidationResult
  - TradeValidationEngine
  - TradeDateValidator (basic version implemented)
- Wrote and ran first failing test (failWhenMaturityBeforeStartDate)
- Connected validation flow with TradeValidationServiceTest
- Confirmed integration structure working (TDD RED phase)
- Git operations:
  - Created new branch feat/comprehensive-trade-validation-engine
  - Committed initial failing test and validation classes
- Planned structure for future validators (User, Leg, Entity)

### Learned / Understood Better

- Role of ChronoUnit.DAYS.between() and why it returns a long type
- How to structure reusable validators for maintainability
- Purpose of separating TradeValidationResult and TradeValidationEngine
- Importance of TDD phases (Red → Green → Refactor)

### Challenges / Notes

- Took me time to decide the structure of classes and methods
- Needed clarity on exception handling (decided to use result aggregation pattern instead of throwing)
- Found writing tests before logic methods harder than writing the logic then tests
- Progress slower due to balancing with home tasks

### Tomorrow (Sunday, Oct 12)

**Goal:** Complete all Date Validation Rule tests and logic (GREEN phase)  
**Estimated time:** ~4–5 hours

#### Tasks

1. Write new failing tests:
   - failWhenStartBeforeTradeDate()
   - failWhenTradeDateOlderThan30Days()
2. Run tests and confirm RED
3. Implement logic in TradeDateValidator
   - Use ChronoUnit.DAYS for 30-day rule
   - Ensure clear error messages
4. Run tests and confirm all GREEN
5. Commit messages:
   - "test(validation): add failing tests for start date and 30-day trade date rules"
   - "fix(validation): implement complete date validation logic"
6. Optional: test through TradeValidationEngine
