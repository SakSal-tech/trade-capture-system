## Understanding what Tradeleg is:

Trade Leg:
A trade leg is a single component or side of a financial trade. Complex trades (like swaps or multi-party deals) are often broken down into multiple legs, each representing a distinct obligation, payment, or position. For example, in a currency swap, one leg might be the payment in USD, and the other leg the payment in EUR. Each leg specifies details like amount, direction (buy/sell), counterparty, and settlement terms.

## Understanding what Trade book is:

Trade Book:
A trade book (or simply “book”) is a collection or grouping of trades managed together, typically by a trading desk, portfolio manager, or business unit. Books help organise trades for risk management, reporting, and performance tracking. For example, a trader might have a “Fixed Income Book” containing all bond trades, or a “FX Book” for currency trades. Books are used to monitor exposures, P&L, and compliance for a set of related trades.
