# Developer log — 30/10/2025 (detailed)

---

### CONTEXT (short)

- Business domain: trades have a business identifier (`trade_id`), metadata (trader, inputter, UTI), and optionally zero-or-more pieces of additional information (we store settlement instructions in `additional_info`).
- Key rules I followed while implementing changes today:
  - Settlement instructions belong to a trade and must be persisted against the trade's business `trade_id` (AdditionalInfo.entity_id = trade.trade_id).
  - User references in trade payloads are numeric ids (backend expects Long), not usernames.
  - UX must be unambiguous: a single Save operation should persist both the trade and its settlement instructions.

---

## Security: Trade user not able to create a new trade

### Completed

- Ensured frontend requests include session credentials (axios withCredentials) so authenticated users can call protected endpoints during dev. This resolved earlier 403s observed when POSTing/PUTing trades.
- Verified that API helpers use explicit parameter types (reduces accidental implicit-any which can lead to malformed requests). Example: `createUser(user: User)`.

Code snippet:

```ts
// frontend/src/utils/api.ts
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true; // ensure session cookie is sent

export function createUser(user: User) {
  return axios.post("/users", user);
}
```

#### Learned

- 403 responses in dev were caused by missing cookies; enabling `withCredentials` and ensuring backend CORS allows credentials resolved the immediate authentication failures.
- Small TypeScript fixes (explicit parameter types) prevent malformed payloads that can cause authorization or validation errors server-side.

### Challenges

- Need to run an end-to-end test to confirm the server accepts the session cookie in all relevant endpoints (POST /trades, PUT /trades/{id}). Some environments still block credentials due to CORS config.

## Business data integrity: Settlement not persisting to AdditionalInfo (entity mapping)

### Completed

- Centralised settlement persistence in the parent modal via `saveSettlement(tradeId, text)` so settlement is saved only after the backend returns the authoritative trade business id.
- Wired `SingleTradeModal` to call `saveSettlement` after a successful trade POST/PUT to ensure AdditionalInfo.entity_id maps to the trade business `trade_id`.

Key code:

```ts
// TradeActionsModal.tsx
async function saveSettlement(tradeId: number, text: string) {
  await api.put(`/trades/${tradeId}/settlement-instructions`, { text });
}

// SingleTradeModal.tsx (after create/update)
if (saveSettlement) await saveSettlement(returned.tradeId, settlement ?? "");
```

#### Learned

- AdditionalInfo rows must reference the trade's business `trade_id` (not the DB surrogate id); waiting for the server response before persisting avoids orphan rows.
- Centralising persistence in the modal parent allows consistent snackbar/error handling and potential retry logic.

### Challenges

- The settlement PUT is reaching the network layer but I could not fully confirm DB insert in my environment—this requires running the frontend + backend locally and capturing server logs and SQL statements to confirm an upsert.

## UX: Adding settlement controls (textarea, templates, label and single-save UX)

### Completed

- Implemented an accessible, labelled settlement textarea with Clear and template insertion. Ensured the textarea exposes an explicit label to address accessibility and testing concerns.
- Removed the per-field Save button from the settlement editor to prevent user confusion; the main Save Trade button now persists settlement.

Code excerpt:

```tsx
<label htmlFor="settlement-text">Settlement instructions</label>
<textarea id="settlement-text" value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />
<button type="button" onClick={() => setValue('')}>Clear</button>
```

#### Learned

- Adding an explicit label and removing duplicate Save controls significantly reduces user errors. Screen readers and automated tests rely on clear labels.
- If templates are provided via a dropdown, that dropdown must have an aria-label so automated accessibility checks and keyboard users can interact with it. Example: `<select aria-label="Settlement templates">`.

### Challenges

- Need to ensure every template control or dropdown has an accessible label — the earlier UX issue reported as "Adding Settlement drop down without a label" is corrected by adding `aria-label` or a visible `<label>`.

### Placement / Visibility work

#### Completed

- Moved the settlement textarea and the templates dropdown from the full-width lower area into the trade modal's right column, directly under the trade header fields so they are visible without scrolling. This required adjusting `TradeActionsModal` markup and CSS grid classes.
- Updated `TradeActionsModal` layout to render the textarea within the right-hand column and ensure it receives focus when the modal opens (improves discoverability).
- Ensured the templates dropdown has an `aria-label` and is keyboard accessible.

Code excerpts (layout change, simplified):

```tsx
// TradeActionsModal.tsx (layout excerpt)
<div className="trade-modal-grid">
  <div className="left-column"> {/* trade inputs */} </div>
  <div className="right-column">
    {/* trade textboxes */}
    <SettlementTextArea initialValue={settlement} />
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Learned

- Placing the settlement editor next to the trade header fields reduces user friction: users naturally look in the same region for categorical trade metadata and related free-text fields.
- Small layout changes can have a large UX impact; verify across a few common screen sizes to avoid overflow/scroll issues inside the modal.

### Challenges

- Need to ensure CSS changes do not regress other modal content. A quick visual test across common resolutions is recommended.

## Data mapping: Trader / Inputter IDs and UTI handling (avoid 400 errors)

### Completed

- Reworked form fields to use `traderUserId` and `tradeInputterUserId` (numeric ids) and updated `staticStore.userValues` to supply `{ value, label }` so dropdowns pass id values.
- Coerced form values into numbers before building the DTO to match backend Long types.

Code excerpt:

```ts
// tradeFormFields.ts
{ key: 'traderUserId', label: 'Trader', type: 'dropdown', options: () => staticStore.userValues ?? [] }

// SingleTradeModal.tsx
const dto = { ...formValues, traderUserId: Number(formValues.traderUserId) || undefined };
```

#### Learned

- The backend validates types strictly; sending usernames or objects where Longs are expected leads to 400 Bad Request. Normalising dropdown values to id strings and coercing them to numbers is the safest approach.

### Challenges

- UTI handling remains unclear: some existing trades have UTIs while newly created ones do not. I need to inspect the backend trade create controller to determine whether UTI is server-generated (recommended) or client-supplied.

## Developer Experience: TypeScript, API contracts and documentation

### Completed

- Introduced `User` interface (`frontend/src/types/User.ts`) and updated API functions to use explicit types instead of `any`.
- Added `.eslintignore` to avoid linting generated files.
- Wrote detailed developer log and error summary documents to capture the work and decisions.

Code excerpt:

```ts
export interface User {
  id: number;
  username: string;
  displayName?: string;
}
export function createUser(user: User) {
  return axios.post("/users", user);
}
```

#### Learned

- Explicit types and small API fixes catch errors early and make the codebase easier to maintain.

### Challenges

- A few legacy call sites still used `any` or passed incomplete objects; these need a small follow-up pass to align types across the codebase.

### Overall next steps (priority)

1. Run end-to-end verification (high) — start backend and frontend locally and perform a create-trade + settlement save flow; capture request/response bodies and server logs.
2. Confirm UTI strategy (medium) — inspect backend trade create controller and DTO; if server-generated, display returned UTI; if not, decide on client generation or input.
3. Add unit tests (medium) — Vitest + React Testing Library tests for `SettlementTextArea` covering template insertion, validation and Clea
