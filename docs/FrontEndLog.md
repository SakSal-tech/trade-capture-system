# Frontend change log — 29 OCtober

## Summary

- Scope: Add a controlled settlement-instructions editor to the Trade Actions modal, persist instructions via the backend AdditionalInfo endpoints, fix frontend linting/build issues and record the work in project documentation.

## What I changed (user-facing and code)

1. Settlement editor (UI)

   - File: `frontend/src/modal/SettlementTextArea.tsx`
   - Implemented a controlled textarea component that supports:
     - an initial value prop, templates (quick-insert), and insert-at-cursor behaviour;
     - local touched state and inline validation (10–500 characters, forbids angle brackets);
     - a character counter, Save and Clear actions, and an isSaving indicator.
   - Small correctness fix (validation): the component now trims input first and applies both length and forbidden-character checks to the trimmed value. This prevents padding with whitespace from bypassing length validation.

2. Modal wiring and persistence

   - File: `frontend/src/modal/TradeActionsModal.tsx`
   - Wired `SettlementTextArea` into the trade modal. Behaviour added:
     - On trade load, the parent fetches the current settlement instructions via GET `/trades/{id}/settlement-instructions`.
     - The parent passes an `onSave` callback which builds an AdditionalInfoRequestDTO and PUTs it to `/trades/{id}/settlement-instructions`.
     - Success and failure are surfaced via the existing Snackbar UI; 404 for GET is treated as "no instructions" (empty editor).
   - Developer comments were added to the modal describing the business mapping (capture at booking, editable during amendments, server-side audit/ownership).

3. Lint/build housekeeping

   - File(s): frontend lint config and small code fixes across components.
   - Action: ensured linter is restricted to source files and added `.eslintignore` (to avoid scanning generated bundles). Fixed small lint items (unused imports/variables and improved axios error handling) so `pnpm run build` can run without ESLint failing.

4. Documentation
   - File: `docs/Errors-and-Fixes-Summary.md` — consolidated problem / root cause / solution / impact entries for the frontend fixes were added.
   - File: `docs/log.md` (this file) — a short developer log entry summarising today's frontend work.

## What I attempted but which changed afterwards

- Unit tests for `SettlementTextArea`: I added a Vitest + React Testing Library test (`frontend/src/__tests__/SettlementTextArea.test.tsx`) covering: initial value rendering, template insertion, validation and save flow. Note: that test file was later reverted/removed in the workspace (the change was undone), so the tests are not present at the time of this log.

## Risks / notes / follow-ups

- Server-side validation and sanitisation: the client performs helpful pre-validation (length and forbids < and >), but final sanitisation and audit/ownership enforcement is the server's responsibility. The client-side checks are for UX only.
- Caret restoration: the editor uses requestAnimationFrame when inserting templates to reliably restore focus/selection across browsers.
- Bundle size: Vite reported a chunk-size warning during builds. This is not functionally blocking but I recommend a follow-up to run the Vite visualiser and consider manualChunks or dynamic imports for large dependencies.
- Tests: the unit tests were created but later reverted; recommend re-adding tests and running them in CI. I can add a minimal test run (Vitest) to the CI pipeline if desired.

## Files changed in this session (high level)

- frontend/src/modal/SettlementTextArea.tsx — controlled settlement editor + validation fix
- frontend/src/modal/TradeActionsModal.tsx — fetch + save wiring, comments
- frontend/.eslintignore and lint script change — restrict lint to source files
- docs/Errors-and-Fixes-Summary.md — summary of errors and fixes
- docs/log.md — this log entry

## How I verified

- Code review of the changed files to ensure validation and save flows are using trimmed values and that axios error handling treats 404 as "not found" for GET.

## Next steps:

1. Recreate and run the Vitest tests for `SettlementTextArea` and fix any test failures.
2. Run `pnpm run build` and address the Vite chunk-size warnings (bundle visualiser + manualChunks).

# Developer log — 30/10/2025 (detailed)

This document records the work I completed on 30 October 2025. It explains what I changed, why I changed it, and how those changes map to business rules about users, trades and settlement instructions. I’ve included code snippets from the repository to make the reasoning concrete for the team.

---

### CONTEXT (short)

- Business domain: trades have a business identifier (`trade_id`), metadata (trader, inputter, UTI), and optionally zero-or-more pieces of additional information (we store settlement instructions in `additional_info`).
- Key rules I followed while implementing changes today:
  - Settlement instructions belong to a trade and must be persisted against the trade's business `trade_id` (AdditionalInfo.entity_id = trade.trade_id).
  - User references in trade payloads are numeric ids (backend expects Long), not usernames.
  - UX must be unambiguous: a single Save operation should persist both the trade and its settlement instructions.

---

## Security: Trade user not able to create a new trade

### Completed

- Ensured frontend requests include session credentials (axios withCredentials) so authenticated users can call protected endpoints during dev. This resolved earlier 403s observed when POSTing/PUTing trades.
- Verified that API helpers use explicit parameter types (reduces accidental implicit-any which can lead to malformed requests). Example: `createUser(user: User)`.

Code snippet:

```ts
// frontend/src/utils/api.ts
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true; // ensure session cookie is sent

export function createUser(user: User) {
  return axios.post("/users", user);
}
```

#### Learned

- 403 responses in dev were caused by missing cookies; enabling `withCredentials` and ensuring backend CORS allows credentials resolved the immediate authentication failures.
- Small TypeScript fixes (explicit parameter types) prevent malformed payloads that can cause authorization or validation errors server-side.

### Challenges

- Need to run an end-to-end test to confirm the server accepts the session cookie in all relevant endpoints (POST /trades, PUT /trades/{id}). Some environments still block credentials due to CORS config.

## Business data integrity: Settlement not persisting to AdditionalInfo (entity mapping)

### Completed

- Centralised settlement persistence in the parent modal via `saveSettlement(tradeId, text)` so settlement is saved only after the backend returns the authoritative trade business id.
- Wired `SingleTradeModal` to call `saveSettlement` after a successful trade POST/PUT to ensure AdditionalInfo.entity_id maps to the trade business `trade_id`.

Key code:

```ts
// TradeActionsModal.tsx
async function saveSettlement(tradeId: number, text: string) {
  await api.put(`/trades/${tradeId}/settlement-instructions`, { text });
}

// SingleTradeModal.tsx (after create/update)
if (saveSettlement) await saveSettlement(returned.tradeId, settlement ?? "");
```

#### Learned

- AdditionalInfo rows must reference the trade's business `trade_id` (not the DB surrogate id); waiting for the server response before persisting avoids orphan rows.
- Centralising persistence in the modal parent allows consistent snackbar/error handling and potential retry logic.

### Challenges

- The settlement PUT is reaching the network layer but I could not fully confirm DB insert in my environment—this requires running the frontend + backend locally and capturing server logs and SQL statements to confirm an upsert.

## UX: Adding settlement controls (textarea, templates, label and single-save UX)

### Completed

- Implemented an accessible, labelled settlement textarea with Clear and template insertion. Ensured the textarea exposes an explicit label to address accessibility and testing concerns.
- Removed the per-field Save button from the settlement editor to prevent user confusion; the main Save Trade button now persists settlement.

Code excerpt:

```tsx
<label htmlFor="settlement-text">Settlement instructions</label>
<textarea id="settlement-text" value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />
<button type="button" onClick={() => setValue('')}>Clear</button>
```

#### Learned

- Adding an explicit label and removing duplicate Save controls significantly reduces user errors. Screen readers and automated tests rely on clear labels.
- If templates are provided via a dropdown, that dropdown must have an aria-label so automated accessibility checks and keyboard users can interact with it. Example: `<select aria-label="Settlement templates">`.

### Challenges

- Need to ensure every template control or dropdown has an accessible label — the earlier UX issue reported as "Adding Settlement drop down without a label" is corrected by adding `aria-label` or a visible `<label>`.

## Data mapping: Trader / Inputter IDs and UTI handling (avoid 400 errors)

### Completed

- Reworked form fields to use `traderUserId` and `tradeInputterUserId` (numeric ids) and updated `staticStore.userValues` to supply `{ value, label }` so dropdowns pass id values.
- Coerced form values into numbers before building the DTO to match backend Long types.

Code excerpt:

```ts
// tradeFormFields.ts
{ key: 'traderUserId', label: 'Trader', type: 'dropdown', options: () => staticStore.userValues ?? [] }

// SingleTradeModal.tsx
const dto = { ...formValues, traderUserId: Number(formValues.traderUserId) || undefined };
```

#### Learned

- The backend validates types strictly; sending usernames or objects where Longs are expected leads to 400 Bad Request. Normalising dropdown values to id strings and coercing them to numbers is the safest approach.

### Challenges

- UTI handling remains unclear: some existing trades have UTIs while newly created ones do not. I need to inspect the backend trade create controller to determine whether UTI is server-generated (recommended) or client-supplied.

## Developer Experience: TypeScript, API contracts and documentation

### Completed

- Introduced `User` interface (`frontend/src/types/User.ts`) and updated API functions to use explicit types instead of `any`.
- Added `.eslintignore` to avoid linting generated files.
- Wrote detailed developer log and error summary documents to capture the work and decisions.

Code excerpt:

```ts
export interface User {
  id: number;
  username: string;
  displayName?: string;
}
export function createUser(user: User) {
  return axios.post("/users", user);
}
```

#### Learned

- Explicit types and small API fixes catch errors early and make the codebase easier to maintain.

### Challenges

- A few legacy call sites still used `any` or passed incomplete objects; these need a small follow-up pass to align types across the codebase.

### Overall next steps (priority)

Add unit tests (medium) — Vitest + React Testing Library tests for `SettlementTextArea` covering template insertion, validation and Clear behaviour.

## UX: Adding settlement controls (textarea, templates, label and single-save UX)

### Completed

- Implemented an accessible, labelled settlement textarea with Clear and template insertion. Ensured the textarea exposes an explicit label to address accessibility and testing concerns.
- Removed the per-field Save button from the settlement editor to prevent user confusion; the main Save Trade button now persists settlement.

Code excerpt:

```tsx
<label htmlFor="settlement-text">Settlement instructions</label>
<textarea id="settlement-text" value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />
<button type="button" onClick={() => setValue('')}>Clear</button>
```

#### Learned

- Adding an explicit label and removing duplicate Save controls significantly reduces user errors. Screen readers and automated tests rely on clear labels.
- If templates are provided via a dropdown, that dropdown must have an aria-label so automated accessibility checks and keyboard users can interact with it. Example: `<select aria-label="Settlement templates">`.

### Challenges

- Need to ensure every template control or dropdown has an accessible label — the earlier UX issue reported as "Adding Settlement drop down without a label" is corrected by adding `aria-label` or a visible `<label>`.

### Placement / Visibility work

#### Completed

- Moved the settlement textarea and the templates dropdown from the full-width lower area into the trade modal's right column, directly under the trade header fields so they are visible without scrolling. This required adjusting `TradeActionsModal` markup and CSS grid classes.
- Updated `TradeActionsModal` layout to render the textarea within the right-hand column and ensure it receives focus when the modal opens (improves discoverability).
- Ensured the templates dropdown has an `aria-label` and is keyboard accessible.

Code excerpts (layout change, simplified):

```tsx
// TradeActionsModal.tsx (layout excerpt)
<div className="trade-modal-grid">
  <div className="left-column"> {/* trade inputs */} </div>
  <div className="right-column">
    {/* trade textboxes */}
    <SettlementTextArea initialValue={settlement} />
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Learned

- Placing the settlement editor next to the trade header fields reduces user friction: users naturally look in the same region for categorical trade metadata and related free-text fields.
- Small layout changes can have a large UX impact; verify across a few common screen sizes to avoid overflow/scroll issues inside the modal.

### Challenges

- Need to ensure CSS changes do not regress other modal content. A quick visual test across common resolutions is recommended.

## Data mapping: Trader / Inputter IDs and UTI handling (avoid 400 errors)

### Completed

- Reworked form fields to use `traderUserId` and `tradeInputterUserId` (numeric ids) and updated `staticStore.userValues` to supply `{ value, label }` so dropdowns pass id values.
- Coerced form values into numbers before building the DTO to match backend Long types.

Code excerpt:

```ts
// tradeFormFields.ts
{ key: 'traderUserId', label: 'Trader', type: 'dropdown', options: () => staticStore.userValues ?? [] }

// SingleTradeModal.tsx
const dto = { ...formValues, traderUserId: Number(formValues.traderUserId) || undefined };
```
