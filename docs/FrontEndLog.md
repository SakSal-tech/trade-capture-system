# Frontend change log — 29 OCtober

This file summarises the frontend development work completed from 11:00 (UK time) on 29/01/2025. It focuses on the settlement-instructions feature, related lint/build fixes, and documentation created to capture decisions and fixes.

## Summary

- Scope: Add a controlled settlement-instructions editor to the Trade Actions modal, persist instructions via the backend AdditionalInfo endpoints, fix frontend linting/build issues and record the work in project documentation.
- Time window covered: from 11:00 (UK) on 29/01/2025 until the end of the day's session.

## What I changed (user-facing and code)

1. Settlement editor (UI)

   - File: `frontend/src/modal/SettlementTextArea.tsx`
   - Implemented a controlled textarea component that supports:
     - an initial value prop, templates (quick-insert), and insert-at-cursor behaviour;
     - local touched state and inline validation (10–500 characters, forbids angle brackets);
     - a character counter, Save and Clear actions, and an isSaving indicator.
   - Small correctness fix (validation): the component now trims input first and applies both length and forbidden-character checks to the trimmed value. This prevents padding with whitespace from bypassing length validation.

2. Modal wiring and persistence

   - File: `frontend/src/modal/TradeActionsModal.tsx`
   - Wired `SettlementTextArea` into the trade modal. Behaviour added:
     - On trade load, the parent fetches the current settlement instructions via GET `/trades/{id}/settlement-instructions`.
     - The parent passes an `onSave` callback which builds an AdditionalInfoRequestDTO and PUTs it to `/trades/{id}/settlement-instructions`.
     - Success and failure are surfaced via the existing Snackbar UI; 404 for GET is treated as "no instructions" (empty editor).
   - Developer comments were added to the modal describing the business mapping (capture at booking, editable during amendments, server-side audit/ownership).

3. Lint/build housekeeping

   - File(s): frontend lint config and small code fixes across components.
   - Action: ensured linter is restricted to source files and added `.eslintignore` (to avoid scanning generated bundles). Fixed small lint items (unused imports/variables and improved axios error handling) so `pnpm run build` can run without ESLint failing.

4. Documentation
   - File: `docs/Errors-and-Fixes-Summary.md` — consolidated problem / root cause / solution / impact entries for the frontend fixes were added.
   - File: `docs/log.md` (this file) — a short developer log entry summarising today's frontend work.

## What I attempted but which changed afterwards

- Unit tests for `SettlementTextArea`: I added a Vitest + React Testing Library test (`frontend/src/__tests__/SettlementTextArea.test.tsx`) covering: initial value rendering, template insertion, validation and save flow. Note: that test file was later reverted/removed in the workspace (the change was undone), so the tests are not present at the time of this log.

## Risks / notes / follow-ups

- Server-side validation and sanitisation: the client performs helpful pre-validation (length and forbids < and >), but final sanitisation and audit/ownership enforcement is the server's responsibility. The client-side checks are for UX only.
- Caret restoration: the editor uses requestAnimationFrame when inserting templates to reliably restore focus/selection across browsers. If you notice platform-specific issues (mobile older browsers), report them and I will add defensive fallbacks.
- Bundle size: Vite reported a chunk-size warning during builds. This is not functionally blocking but I recommend a follow-up to run the Vite visualiser and consider manualChunks or dynamic imports for large dependencies.
- Tests: the unit tests were created but later reverted; recommend re-adding tests and running them in CI. I can add a minimal test run (Vitest) to the CI pipeline if desired.

## Files changed in this session (high level)

- frontend/src/modal/SettlementTextArea.tsx — controlled settlement editor + validation fix
- frontend/src/modal/TradeActionsModal.tsx — fetch + save wiring, comments
- frontend/.eslintignore and lint script change — restrict lint to source files
- docs/Errors-and-Fixes-Summary.md — summary of errors and fixes
- docs/log.md — this log entry

## How I verified

- Code review of the changed files to ensure validation and save flows are using trimmed values and that axios error handling treats 404 as "not found" for GET.
- Local lint fixes applied where obvious issues existed (unused variables, unsafe any) to let the frontend build pass. If you want, I can run `pnpm run build` and share the output (or fix any remaining issues).

## Next steps:

1. Recreate and run the Vitest tests for `SettlementTextArea` and fix any test failures.
2. Run `pnpm run build` and address the Vite chunk-size warnings (bundle visualiser + manualChunks).
3. Merge the short log into the longer `DeveloperLog.md` or `FrontEndDeveloperLog.md` if you prefer a single canonical record.
