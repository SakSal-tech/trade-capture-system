### Sunday, 26 October 2025 — Settlement instructions validation refactor

**Focus:** Settlement instructions validation refactor, audit wiring and service integration

**Hours active:** 2 hrs

### Completed

- I centralised settlement-instruction validation into a single field-level validator class, `SettlementInstructionValidator`.

  - Rules implemented: optional field; trim/normalise input; length 10–500 characters; forbid semicolons; detect and reject unescaped single/double quotes; deny common SQL-like tokens (for example `DROP TABLE`, `DELETE FROM`); and a final allowed-character check that permits escaped quotes and structured punctuation.
  - Error messages were improved to be user-friendly and include a copyable example for escaping quotes (for example: `Settle note: client said \"urgent\"`).

- I added a small adapter entry point to the existing validation orchestration: `TradeValidationEngine.validateSettlementInstructions(String)`.

  - This adapter delegates to the field-level validator and returns a `TradeValidationResult` to callers, enabling consistent access to settlement validation from services that already use the engine.

- I integrated the validation into `AdditionalInfoService` at three locations: `createAdditionalInfo`, `updateAdditionalInfo` and `upOrInsertTradeSettlementInstructions`.

  - When `fieldName` equals `SETTLEMENT_INSTRUCTIONS` the service calls the engine adapter and throws `IllegalArgumentException` with the first validation message when validation fails.
  - Non-settlement `AdditionalInfo` entries retain the previous lightweight checks so behaviour for other fields is unchanged.

- Small naming clarifications were made at integration points (replaced short variable `vr` with `validationResult`) and concise refactor comments were added to explain why validation was centralised.

- Audit-trail wiring was verified: `AdditionalInfoAudit` records old and new values, the actor (`changedBy`) is resolved from the Spring Security context with a sensible fallback, and timestamps are recorded for each change.

### Rationale & business mapping

- Centralising validation provides a single source of truth for settlement-business rules and supports the operations requirement that settlement instructions are safe, consistent and searchable.

- Business-driven rules implemented:

  - Optional field — operations can omit instructions when unnecessary.
  - Length bounds (10–500) — ensures instructions are informative but bounded for storage, display and index performance.
  - Semicolon ban & SQL-token blacklist — mitigate common injection patterns before persistence.
  - Escaped-quote enforcement — preserves user intent and avoids ambiguity while keeping stored text safe to display.

- The engine adapter allows callers to access field-level validation from the same orchestration point used for trade-level rules, avoiding awkward caller-side wiring.

### Learned

- Field-level validators are the right abstraction for free-text fields — they are small, focused and easy to unit test.
- Providing a single engine entry point keeps validation discoverable and consistent across services.
- Example-based error messages materially help inexperienced users correct input (the escape example was added for exactly this reason).

### Challenges

- A small non-functional inconsistency remains: the `settlementInstructionValidator` field is still present in the service while validation is routed via the `TradeValidationEngine` adapter. This causes a compiler warning for an unused field and should be tidied in a follow-up.

- Balancing strict safety rules (for example forbidding semicolons) with everyday user convenience required a deliberate decision in favour of safety, plus clearer messaging to users.

### Next steps

1. Remove the now-unused `settlementInstructionValidator` field (or adjust the engine adapter to use the injected instance) to clear compiler warnings.
2. Add unit tests for `SettlementInstructionValidator` covering:\
   - Accept: escaped quotes and valid length boundaries.\
   - Reject: unescaped quotes, semicolons, SQL-like tokens, and out-of-range lengths.
3. Add a small integration test for `AdditionalInfoService` asserting that invalid settlement instructions throw `IllegalArgumentException`, that valid values persist, and that audit records are created.
4. Consider moving settlement `AdditionalInfo` creation into the same transactional boundary as `TradeService.createTrade` so trade creation and settlement persistence are atomic.

### Summary

These changes make settlement instructions safer to store and simpler to validate consistently across the application. They support the business goals of searchable settlement text for operations, auditable changes for compliance, and robust input validation to reduce operational risk.
