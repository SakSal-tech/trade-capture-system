## SettlementTextArea

### Why use Typing Props:

- Typing props ensures initialValue is handled as a string, so your useState(initialValue) is typed and safe.
- Templates dropdown: typing each template as {value,label} makes mapping and inserting safe (no accidental undefined).
- Validation & tests: Type annotations help write tests (I know the shape) and catch type-related bugs early.
- Readability & future maintenance: other people (or future I) can see the expected inputs/outputs for the component.

### ??

a ?? b is the nullish coalescing operator. It returns a unless a is null or undefined; otherwise it returns b.
Why that matters (example):

0 ?? 5 → 0 (keeps zero)
"" ?? "fallback" → "" (keeps empty string)
null ?? "fallback" → "fallback"
Contrast with ||:

a || b returns b when a is any falsy value (0, "", false, null, undefined).
So 0 || 5 → 5 (often wrong if 0 is a meaningful value).
In SettlementTxtArea:

const start = txtArea.selectionStart ?? txtArea.value.length;
If selectionStart is 0 (cursor at start), start will be 0 — correct.
If selectionStart is null/undefined, it falls back to value.length.

### Use of Touched

- touched" is a simple boolean state that tracks whether the user has interacted with the input.]=
- Use it to control when to show validation messages and whether to let external updates overwrite the user's in-progress edits.

Why it helps:

- UX: Don’t show "This field is required" before the user tries to edit — show validation only after they've touched/blurred the field.
- Safety when syncing props: If the parent updates initialValue, I usually want to update the textarea only when the user hasn't started typing. touched lets I avoid stomping their edits. e.g.
  ` setTouched(false); // treat as fresh content`

### Use of Controlled textarea:

- Keeps the visible text and your internal state in sync so the component is “controlled” (required for predictable validation, saving, tests).
- Validation & UI: because state updates on each keystroke, your validators/char-counter can read value and render live feedback or disable Save.
- Insert-at-cursor / templates: after inserting template text I also update value (same state path), so all code reads a single source of truth.
  Tests: easy to simulate user typing by calling onchange and asserting value changes.

### function handleChange

- Purpose: it reads the string from the textarea event and calls setValue(...) to update component state so the textarea can be used as a controlled component.
- Types: the parameter is typed as ChangeEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>, which gives the handler a correctly typed event object for a <textarea>. That makes evt.currentTarget a strongly‑typed HTMLTextAreaElement and ensures TypeScript knows value is a string.
- currentTarget vs target: using evt.currentTarget.value is preferable here because currentTarget is typed as the element that the handler is bound to; evt.target can be less predictable and less well typed.
- Requirements: setValue must come from a React useState hook and ChangeEvent must be imported (or referenced as React.ChangeEvent). The handler must be wired to the textarea's onChange and the textarea should have its value prop set from state to avoid uncontrolled/controlled warnings.

### Use of text selection & Focus

`onst start = txtArea.selectionStart ?? txtArea.value.length;`

- The cursor or selection start index inside the settlement-instructions textarea.
  Trade example: a trader clicks into the instructions after “Reference: ” (cursor at position 45). start becomes 45 so an inserted template (e.g., “BENEFICIARY: …”) goes exactly after the Reference text.
- Why the fallback: if the browser can’t report selectionStart (rare), the code uses txtArea.value.length (append to the end). That prevents losing the template — e.g., when the textarea isn’t fully mounted I still add the template at the end of the current settlement text.
- UX reason for ?? : preserves 0 (cursor at document start). If the cursor is at index 0 we must treat 0 as valid — ?? does that; || would mistakenly treat 0 as “missing” and append instead.

`const end = txtArea.selectionEnd ?? start;`

- Trade example: trader highlights the beneficiary account line and picks a “UBS — Beneficiary” template. start/end enclose the highlighted range so the code replaces that entire selected text with the template (good for overwriting outdated account lines).
- If no selection (cursor only), end falls back to start so insertion replaces a zero-length selection (i.e., it just inserts at the cursor).
  Requirement fit:
- Insert-at-cursor: puts templates exactly where the trader wants (improves speed and accuracy for settlement info).
- Replace selection: lets trader select an old beneficiary block and replace it in one action (prevents duplicate/contradictory instructions).
- Safe fallback: if selection info is unavailable, we still append the template instead of throwing — avoids lost user action during edge cases (fast workflow, mounting timing).

`setValue((prevValue) => prevValue.slice(0, start) + text + prevValue.slice(end));`

- Uses the functional state updater to take the previous textarea string and produce a new string where the substring from index start to end is replaced by text. Implementation: prevValue.slice(0, start) keeps everything before the caret/selection, + text is the inserted template, + prevValue.slice(end) keeps everything after the selection.
- It reads the latest state (prevValue) safely even if other updates are queued — important in React when multiple events/update cycles may race.
- Insert-at-cursor: inserts exactly where the trader placed the caret or replaces the highlighted selection (so a trader can replace an old beneficiary line with the UBS template in one action).
  Single source of truth: all edits go through component state so validation, save, and char-count logic read the same value.
  No duplicate instructions: replacing a selected block prevents leaving the old IBAN and adding a new one (reduces settlement errors).
  `window.requestAnimationFrame(() => { ... });`
- Schedules the inner DOM actions to run after the browser has painted the update caused by setValue. Because state updates are asynchronous and React re-renders, this ensures the textarea DOM reflects the new value before manipulating focus/selection.
  `txtArea.focus();`
- Returns keyboard focus to the textarea so the trader can continue typing immediately (good UX).
  Why it matters for settlement flow: after inserting a template the trader usually needs to fill placeholders (e.g., [NAME], [TRADE ID]); focus keeps workflow fluid and fast.

`txtArea.setSelectionRange(start + text.length, start + text.length);`

- Moves the caret to the position immediately after the inserted text (both start and end set to same index → no selection).
  Why that choice: places the insertion point so the trader can continue editing the inserted template (cursor sits right after it). If a selection was replaced, caret ends after the replacement; if inserted at caret, same result.
- Requirement linkage: helps quick post-insert edits (fill-in placeholders) and reduces clicks — important for traders who need fast, accurate settlement instruction edits.

### defaultTemplates ready made array with settlements trader can edit

DefaultTemplates is a local fallback list of common settlement instruction blocks (examples) — it does NOT automatically write into a trade. It’s only shown/inserted when the user chooses a template. The array exists to speed and standardize trader input; if I prefer traders always type from scratch I can remove it or replace it with an empty list or load templates from the server per-user.

Quick line-by-line

const defaultTemplates = [ ... ]
A hard-coded array of objects: { value: string, label: string }.
Each entry is a ready-made instruction block (value) plus a short label for the UI.
Later: const templatesToUse = templates && templates.length ? templates : defaultTemplates;
If the parent passed templates props, we use those; otherwise we fall back to defaultTemplates.
Important: falling back to this array only makes template options available in the UI — it does not change the trade unless the user inserts one.
Why have templates (benefits for trade settlement)

Speed: traders often reuse the same payment blocks (beneficiary, intermediary, charges). Templates let them insert standardized text quickly.
Accuracy & consistency: reduces manual typos and inconsistent instruction formats (helps settlement processing downstream).
UX: with insert-at-cursor, templates let a trader replace or augment specific lines (e.g., replace an outdated beneficiary) without retyping the whole block.

#### How can traders edit the default list

How editable it is depends on two things in this component:

Insertion behavior (replace vs append)
If a range is selected, the code replaces that range with the template:
prevValue.slice(0, start) + text + prevValue.slice(end)
That means the selected text is gone and the template is now in the document in its place — editable like normal text.
If no selection, the template is inserted at the caret (or appended if selection info is unavailable).
Caret/focus handling (lets trader continue typing without extra clicks)
The code calls:
txtArea.focus();
txtArea.setSelectionRange(start + text.length, start + text.length);
That places the caret immediately after the inserted template and gives keyboard focus so the trader can type into the inserted template without clicking.
Important caveats for the current file state

All that works only if the textarea DOM node is attached to textareaRef (so txtArea isn't null). If textareaRef is not attached, the function falls back to appending the template and does not call focus/setSelectionRange, so the trader can still edit but must click into the field to place the caret.
The component also uses a touched flag and a syncing effect. If touched is used to prevent external updates from overwriting the field, the trader’s edits won’t be clobbered by parent initialValue updates while they’re typing.
UX / requirements mapping (trade settlement)

Fast accurate edits: replacing a highlighted beneficiary line with a standard “UBS — Beneficiary” template prevents duplicate/conflicting instructions and lets the trader then fill placeholders (e.g., IBAN) immediately.
Low friction: focus + caret placement keeps the trader in flow — no extra clicks required to edit after inserting a template.
Safety: because all edits go through component state, validation and the save flow will see the inserted-and-edited value before submission.

What’s already done (from the file I shared)

Controlled textarea with state (value, setValue).
DOM ref attached (textareaRef) and insertAtCursor implemented.
touched flag and onBlur are wired so errors show only after interaction.
A validator (isValid) enforces trimmed length (10–500) and forbids </>.
Inline validation message renders when invalid and touched.
What’s still missing / recommended (high-priority)

Save / Clear UI and wiring
Add Save and Clear Buttons and wire Save to either a parent onSave(value) callback or the settlement PUT API.
Disable Save while invalid: use disabled={!isValid(value)}.
Clear should setValue("") and setTouched(false).
Async UX (medium priority)
Loading state for an in-flight save and a Snackbar for success/error.
Template UI (UX)
I still need a visible templates picker (native <select> or the project Dropdown) that calls insertAtCursor(...) — currently templatesToUse is defined but not used in the JSX.
Decide template semantics: if an explicit empty array from parent should mean “no templates”, change fallback to const templatesToUse = templates === undefined ? defaultTemplates : templates;
Accessibility and small fixes
Link the label to the textarea for screen-readers: give the textarea an id and change label to <label htmlFor="settlement-instructions">.
Consider returning clearer validation messages (e.g., "Must be at least 10 characters") rather than a single generic line.
Tests & docs
Unit tests for insertion-at-cursor, validation behavior, Save disabled state.
README/UX note describing validation rules and template behavior.
Server-side: ensure server validates/sanitizes — client checks are UX-only.
Potential code/quality notes

Linter might warn that the useEffect references touched but doesn't list it in deps — this is intentional (I prevent stomping user edits), but consider documenting the intention in a comment or using a clearer effect condition.
isValid currently tests text for </> rather than trimmed; either is fine, but be consistent.
The label isn't linked to the textarea id (accessibility gap).
No obvious syntax errors in the snippet I shared.
Suggested next step (one small change)

I need first adding the accessibility fix (small, safe, and quick). If I want, I can give the exact single line to paste now:

Replace the label line with:
<label htmlFor="settlement-instructions"> Settlement Instructions</label>
And replace the textarea line with:<textarea id="settlement-instructions" ref={textareaRef} value={value} onChange={handleChange} onBlur={() => setTouched(true)} />
