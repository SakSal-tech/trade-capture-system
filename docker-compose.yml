# docker-compose: orchestrates backend and frontend for local development
# - backend: built from ./backend, exposed on host:8080
# - frontend: built from ./frontend and served by nginx on container:80 mapped to host:3000
# - backend healthcheck probes /actuator/health (enable Spring Actuator for readiness)
# - restart policies help keep services up during local development
